# Scala Collections tasks

## Tasks

Purpose is to learn how to operate with streams and monadic collections:
* Initialization
* Manipulating contained values
* Minimizing hardware resources required for processing
* Dealing with failures

Fork this repository and work individually on copied repository.

Implement unimplemented methods and functions so that all tests pass. Goal is to provide most elegant solution possible.

## Suggested order

Start with **monadic** or **streams.scala**, finish with **streams.akka**.
